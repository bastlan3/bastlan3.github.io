            <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
            <p>I am an EPFL Data Science engineer with a minor in computational neuroscience and a bachelor's in life science engineering. My primary interest is to better understand neural mechanisms and their links to deep learning algorithms to improve both bio-inspired DL and brain modelisations. I am currently an Associate in Neurobiology in the Livinstone lab at Harvard Medical School.</p>

            <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2024: Master Degree in Data Sciences Engineering with a minor in Computational Neuroscience, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</li>
                <li>2020: Bachelor Degree in Life Sciences Engineering, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="experience">Research Experience</h2>
            <h3> 2024: Center for Brain Mind and Machine summer course, Wood's Hole Marine Biology Lab - MIT </h3>
            <p> The course enrolls 30 graduate students and postdocs from around the world, and provides a “deep end” introduction to the problem of intelligence - how the brain produces intelligent behavior and how we may be able to replicate intelligence in machines.
                Like CBMM itself, the philosophy of the course is that the synergistic combination of neuroscience, cognitive science, mathematics, and computer science, will lead to the creation of much more robust and sophisticated algorithms implemented in intelligent machines and will accelerate the scientific investigation of how intelligent behavior emerges from neural activity in the brain.</p>
            <p>My personnal project was an attempt at creating adversarial images based on diffusion models and also using robust-harmonised neural networks(harmonised nn coming from serre-lab)</p>
             <h3>2024: Master Thesis and Research in bio-inspired ML, Boston Children Hospital Institute - Harvard Medical School</h3>
    
            <p>Investigated the relationship between adversarial robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their ability to model primate vision. Key findings include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Robust CNNs, trained using adversarial methods, align better with neural responses in the primate visual cortex.</li>
              <li>Adversarial robustness is crucial for developing CNNs that accurately model biological vision.</li>
              <li>Attack images from robust models are more realistic for primates.</li>
              <li>One robust neural network showed higher correlation to monkey neural data than the correlation between monkey and human data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This research offers insights into neural mechanisms underlying visual perception in primates and demonstrates the potential of CNNs to achieve primate-level performance in adversarial tasks.</p>

            <h3>2023: Semester Research Project, SIMPLA lab - University of Oslo (UiO)</h3>
            <p>Worked on the prediction of Allen institute electrophysiological neural data in mice using deep learning. The project involved building several models predicting the spike counts in response to images (natural scenes or gratings) in the V1 cortex of a mouse using Neuropixel data. Among the 5 models benchmarked, a CNN model using pre-trained image classification weights and linear-batchnorm-linear layers made good predictions on the average spike counts. Additionally, created images that would cause the most spikes for a predicted neuron, to investigate the relationship between these most exciting images and the predicted neuron position.</p>

            <h3>2023: Semester Research Project, Mathis lab - EPFL</h3>
            <p>Conducted policy analysis in the learning process of the winning model from the Myosuite baoding ball challenge. This involved working with a musculoskeletal simulator using curriculum learning and PPO with LSTM algorithm. Specifically, worked on low dimension projection of an RL model of musculoskeletal motor control of the forearm and the hand. Used CEBRA (a machine-learning method used to compress time series that reveals structures in the variability of the data) to show how the model stored environmental variables during a trial and how the LSTM cell learned along the curriculum learning process to act for new tasks.</p>

            <h3>2021: Intern in Lixoft</h3>
            <p>Built a library of mathematical models of viruses via an extensive literature review to be used on the Monolix suite.</p>

            <h3>2019: Bachelor Research Project, CIBM - EPFL</h3>
            <p>Mapped the auditory pathway using different MRI techniques.</p>
